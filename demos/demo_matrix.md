# Demo - Contiguous matrix class

The contiguous matrix class is basically a contiguous representation of vector<vector<int>>, storing the information in a single vector<int>.

The class interface still attempts to (mostly) resemble the interface for vector<vector<int>>, with some differences.

Source code:

  \include demo_matrix.cpp
